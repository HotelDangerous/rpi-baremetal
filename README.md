# Raspberry Pi 3B+ Bare Metal Series
This repository documents my full journey into bare-metal Raspberry Pi development, progressing chapter-by-chapter from the simplest possible program to building a real RTOS.

Each chapter is fully self-contained, with its own source code, build system, and documentation so that others can follow along and grow their skills the same way.

## Chapters
### Chapter 00 – Minimal LED (GPIO16 ON)
Turns GPIO16 on using pure ARM64 assembly.
